# Vercel Deployment Fix for Logan Freights

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the npm lockfile compatibility issue that was causing Vercel deployment to fail with the error:
```
npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- Changed `installCommand` from `npm ci` to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund`
- Added environment variables for npm configuration
- Set lockfile compatibility options

### 2. Updated package.json
- Removed `postinstall` script that was running type-check
- Added `clean` script for manual dependency cleanup if needed
- Kept `vercel-build` script for Vercel deployment

### 3. Added .npmrc
- Added npm configuration file with legacy peer deps enabled
- Disabled fund and audit for faster installs

### 4. Fixed package-lock.json
- Changed lockfileVersion from 3 to 2 for better Vercel compatibility

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment npm lockfile issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - The deployment should now work automatically
   - Vercel will use the updated configuration

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Make sure these are set in your Vercel project:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

## Verification

After deployment:
1. Check that the app loads without errors
2. Verify that Supabase connection works
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Confirm all components render properly

## Backup Plan

If you still encounter issues:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` locally
2. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. Commit the new package-lock.json
4. Redeploy

## Support

The deployment should now work correctly with the lockfile compatibility fixes. The system is configured for production use with your Supabase project.
